# CalMerge

CalMerge is a Laravel application designed to merge multiple ICS calendar feeds into a single, unified feed. It allows users to select specific calendars they want to subscribe to and generates a unique URL for their custom feed.

## Features

-   **Merge Calendars**: Combine multiple ICS feeds into one.
-   **Grouped Sources**: Organize calendar sources into groups for easier navigation.
-   **Hidden Calendars**: Support for hidden calendars that are only visible and accessible via a specific access token.
-   **Access Control**: Enforces access token checks for hidden calendars to prevent unauthorized subscriptions.
